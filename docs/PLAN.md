# Malta Trip Guide - Session Plan
## Session: arena/8f0b561b-maltasupplemental (11 October 2026)

### Repository Review

**Starting Point:** Repository at commit `ac487ae472be53b07cc37b1ef839e54460bd6b65` on `main`

**Current State:** The repository contains a comprehensive static GitHub Pages site with:
- 7 JSON data files (transport, food, activities, everyday, radio, expenses, event)
- 15+ HTML pages (index, event, getting-around, restaurants, activities, everyday, radio, costs, hotel, qawra, landmarks, itinerary, logistics, hotspawn, sources)
- Shared CSS (css/style.css)
- JavaScript (js/site.js)
- Documentation (PLAN.md, STATUS.md, SOURCES.md, OPEN_QUESTIONS.md, HANDOFF.md, DATA_SCHEMA.md, FINAL_REPORT.md)
- CI workflow with validation tests
- Canonical 13-field schema for all records

**Trip Context:**
- Hotel: AX ODYCY Malta, Qawra Coast Road, Qawra SPB 1902, Malta
- Room: Deluxe sea view
- Dates: 13th October 2026 - 19th October 2026
- Event: Counterstrike 2 Thunderpick World Championship 2026 at BLAST Arena Studios, Attard
- Website: https://axhotelsmalta.com/odycy/

### Session Objectives

Complete the work to satisfy the entire user prompt through three verification passes:

1. **Pass 1: Implement and verify** - Review all existing work, verify facts, fill gaps
2. **Pass 2: Adversarial review** - Check for bugs, missing requirements, incorrect assumptions
3. **Pass 3: Full request audit** - Map every line of the original request against the integrated result

### Workstream Ownership (Parallel Work Protocol)

| Stream | Owned Files | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A · Transport** | `data/transport.json`, `getting-around.html` | Airport/hotel/event travel, public bus routes (especially hotel to BLAST Arena Studios), fares, cards, return options, taxi/ride-hailing, rentals, ferries. Compare feasibility, convenience, price, value. | To Do |
| **B · Food & cafés** | `data/food.json`, `restaurants.html` | Qawra/hotel and Malta eateries with Google Reviews, Google Maps, Yelp, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Reddit, X sources. Organize by popularity, categories, sections. | To Do |
| **C · Gaming, activities, landmarks & events** | `data/activities.json`, `activities.html`, `data/event.json`, `event.html` | Gaming centers, PC cafes, arcades, landmarks, dated events during trip window. | To Do |
| **D · Everyday life (US traveler)** | `data/everyday.json`, `everyday.html` | Plugs/voltage, SIM/eSIM, money/tipping, safety, health, customs, language, weather. All with official sources. | To Do |
| **E · Sports radio** | `data/radio.json`, `radio.html` | Malta stations, frequencies (FM/DAB+), official schedules, trip-date listings for EPL, soccer, sports broadcasts. Verify live over radio with AM/FM/DAB+ devices. | To Do |
| **F · Expense planner** | `data/expenses.json`, `costs.html` | Data-driven template, quick to fill once itinerary arrives. | To Do |
| **G · Site shell, executive summary & navigation** | `index.html`, `js/site.js`, `css/style.css`, `sources.html`, `README.md`, `docs/*` | Integrates all workstreams, navigation, executive summary, shared files. Runs last. | To Do |

### Conflict Avoidance Rules

1. **File Ownership:** Each workstream edits ONLY its owned files
2. **Shared Files:** Only workstream G edits shared files (navigation, index, CSS, README, executive summary)
3. **Cross-Stream Findings:** Add to `docs/HANDOFF.md`, not to another stream's files
4. **Unverified Items:** Record in `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, never present as fact
5. **Branch Strategy:** One branch per workstream, but Arena provides fixed branch, so work serially

### Data Schema (Canonical 13 Fields)

All records must include:
1. `id` - Unique identifier
2. `name` - Display name
3. `category` - Classification
4. `area` - Geographic area
5. `address` - Physical address
6. `hours` - Operating hours
7. `price range` - Cost information
8. `description` - Detailed description
9. `source_url` - Verifiable source URL
10. `source_type` - official/map/review/social
11. `date_checked` - When verified
12. `confidence` - verified/partially verified/unverified
13. `notes` - Additional context
